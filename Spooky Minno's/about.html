        <p class="about">Most notably known for his future time piece "The Beginning of the End: An Essay on Techno-Decay", Spooky Minno
was known for his wild exploits.
            <br>
            He had inherited an enormous amount of coin after his family died on a
ski trip in Colorado. They were smashed by a !!ski trolley???!! and killed upon contact.
            <br>
Spooky recieved word while attending a science camp in the summer of 2032. 
In an academically titilating environment, Spooky was in his prime. Sipping on the electricity of the experiments.
            <br>
The moment that he heard the news of his parents he had only a brief moment of grief. This was truly an awful moment, but Spooky had "things" to do.
            <br>
It seemed the exact wrong time to reach out to him. he had successfully completed his experiment. He was in the computer.</p>
